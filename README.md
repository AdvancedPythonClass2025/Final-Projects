# Final Projects Repository

This repository contains the final projects for the Advanced Python course. Each project represents a comprehensive application of the course concepts and demonstrates practical programming skills.

## Repository Structure

Each group has a dedicated folder for their final project. All team members can contribute to their project folder through pull requests.

## Project Submission Guidelines

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Final-Projects
